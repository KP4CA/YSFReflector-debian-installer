# YSFReflector-debian-installer
This is a simple script that runs through the steps of the install at: https://register.ysfreflector.de/installation. The script currently does not have a startup/stop script and is only compatible with Debian.
******

To start YSFReflector, run: '/YSFRflector/YSFRflector YSFRflector.ini' 

To stop YSFReflector: 'ps aux | grep YSFreflector', then kill the pid.

Its an ugly way of starting and stopping, but it works. I will focus on fixing this in later versions of the script. For now though, it just works. 

By all means, please dissect the script and make it work for your install....then share with the world. 

73!
